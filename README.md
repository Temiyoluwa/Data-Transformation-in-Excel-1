# Data-Transformation-in-Excel-1
## This data transformation briefly works through a process of loading excel formats directly from a folder. each folder contains same information with equal of number columns. The idea is to create an ETL process that loads data from a folder, transforms it and append them together into a consolidated table. 

## Excel file folder showing sales information for different sales person in different region. Additionally a random file of different file format..
